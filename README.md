## Description

Assignment for the UW Coding Bootcamp; due 06/27/22. The objective was to make a password generator, all parameters seem to be met. As frustrated as I got with this assignment this was by far the most satisfying to finish.

## Confidence in Assignment

---

I hit all the parameters that were asked of me in the orignial prompt so I am happy about that. I am pretty sure that the way that I did things wasn't quite what the intentions of the assignment. Either way out of everthing so far this was my favorite assignment of the class so far and I hope that we have more work that aligns along this way.
